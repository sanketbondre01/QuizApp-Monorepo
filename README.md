# QuizApp Monorepo

## Project Overview
QuizApp is a comprehensive monorepo project designed to manage quizzes and questions. It offers full CRUD functionalities for both quizzes and questions, integrated with a MySQL database, Swagger API documentation, and robust exception handling.

## Monorepo 
A Monorepo (short for Monolithic Repository) is a software development strategy where the code for multiple projects, applications, or services is stored in a single repository, rather than having separate repositories for each project.
